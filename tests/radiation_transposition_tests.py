    This function tests dhi transpositions, proper testing is unfortunately difficult so this just checks physical

    This set of tests focuses on tilt 0 cases as these tend to be easier to check.

    Only the isotropic model is easy to understand, it will always equal to dhi when tilt is 0.
    Both perez and perez_driesse models start to decrease when AOI is 85+
    This might be unwanted since if DHI is 100W/m² and panel tilt is 0, panels should receive 100w of dhi radiation
